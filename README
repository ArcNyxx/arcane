arcane - qmk keyboard configuration
===================================
arcane is a flashy mechanical keyboard configuration made with qmk.  arcane
features both solid and split reactive backlighting configurations and a qwerty
layout with macros and special keys for specialised for programming with vim.

Requirements
------------
arcane requires teensy_loader_cli, avr-gcc version 8, and qmk_firmware.

Installation
------------
arcane can be downloaded, built, and flashed with the following commands:

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/zsa/qmk_firmware/

    pacman -S teensy_loader_cli
    pacman -U https://archive.archlinux.org/packages/a/avr-gcc/
        avr-gcc-8.3.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz

    cd qmk_firmware
    cp util/udev/50-qmk.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

    git clone https://github.com/arcnyxx/arcane/
    mkdir -p keyboards/ergodox_ez/shine/keymaps/
    mv arcane keyboards/ergodox_ez/shine/keymaps/arcane
    make ergodox_ez/shine:arcane:flash


Configuration
-------------
arcane can be configured by editing the keymap.c file and (re)compiling the
source code.  This keeps it fast, simple, and secure.
